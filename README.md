# go-react

## Introduction

This is a website that allows you to choose movies based on name and genres. The website also allows admin to add/ remove/ modify movies and users info

I built this website using React for front-end, Golang for back-end, JWT for authentication, Postgres, GraphQL for DB.

Notice that since this is the first time I work with Golang so some documentation might seem obvious to some you who are more experienced with Golang.
